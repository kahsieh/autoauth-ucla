# AutoAuth for UCLA
Speed up UCLA Single Sign-On.

- This is a WebExtension designed for Firefox and Chrome. To install, please go
  to Firefox Add-ons or the Chrome Web Store.
- For Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) users, you can give AutoAuth your next
  10 SMS passcodes and it will automatically enter them until you need new
  passcodes. AutoAuth also automatically checks "Remember me for 12 hours" when
  it's available.
- Usage: Sign in normally. On the MFA screen, if AutoAuth prompts you to enter
  new passcodes, then press "Text me new codes" and enter the 10 passcodes you
  receive. It's recommended that you use Google Voice or iMessage in order to
  easily copy-paste the codes, and that you continue using Duo Push when away
  from your primary computer.
- Firefox only: AutoAuth also automatically signs in with your UCLA Logon ID
  and UCLA Logon Password if your browser is set to fill them in automatically.
- Uses graphic(s) from [Material Design](https://material.io/icons/).
