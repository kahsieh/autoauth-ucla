- This is a WebExtension designed for Firefox and Chrome. To install, please
  go to Firefox Add-ons or the Chrome Web Store.
- For Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) users, you can give AutoAuth your next
  10 SMS passcodes and it will automatically enter them until you need new
  passcodes. AutoAuth also automatically checks "Remember me for 12 hours" when
  it's available. It's still recommended that you use Duo Push when away from
  your primary computer.
- Firefox only: AutoAuth automatically signs in with your UCLA Logon ID and
  UCLA Logon Password if your browser is set to fill them in automatically.
- Uses graphic(s) from [Material Design](https://material.io/icons/).
